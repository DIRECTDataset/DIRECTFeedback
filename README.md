# DIRECT-Feedback
### Description
This dataset holds feedback presented in the context of interactive reading comprehension exercises. It is an extension of [DIRECT](https://github.com/DIRECTDataset/DIRECT). For DIRECT, incorrect answers were constructed by selecting faulty answer options from a pre-defined multiple choice form. Those are often totally unrelated to the actual reading passage. We decided to construct additional data with more natural answers, including mistakes that students are likely to make in an environment where only the reading passage and no answer options are provided. For each question in the DIRECT dataset, one annotator in the student role constructs such an answer, then another annotator in the tutor role constructs the corresponding feedback. Both annotators are presented with the reading passage, the question, its correct answer, and the corresponding key sentences. Five annotators with some level of English proficiency worked on the student role, while two native English-speaking annotators worked on the tutor role. The latter were also asked to periodically review randomly selected portions of the constructed data, including both incorrect answers and tutor feedback (constructed by the other worker). They ensured that the percentage of erroneous data items remained below 5%.
